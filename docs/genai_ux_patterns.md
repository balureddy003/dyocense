# GenAI UX Patterns for SMB Business Tools

This guide summarizes evolving GenAI UX patterns to ensure the Dyocense platform delivers the simplest, most intuitive experience for SMB users. All agentic tools should prioritize ease of use, conversational flows, and minimal cognitive load.

## Core Principles

- **Conversational First:** Use chat-driven interfaces for all major workflows. Users interact naturally, ask questions, and receive guidance from agents.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only what’s needed at each step. Avoid overwhelming users with options or data.
- **Contextual Guidance:** Agents proactively surface tips, next actions, and clarifications based on user context and intent.
- **One-Click Actions:** Minimize friction with single-click confirmations, smart defaults, and auto-complete.
- **Visual Summaries:** Use cards, charts, and highlights for key insights—never dense tables or complex dashboards.
- **Inline Feedback:** Provide instant validation, error correction, and suggestions within the chat or form flow.
- **Personalization:** Adapt UI and agent responses to user role, business type, and recent activity.
- **Zero Setup:** Tools should work out-of-the-box with sample data, onboarding flows, and agent walkthroughs.

## Evolving GenAI Patterns

- **Chat + Action Cards:** Combine conversational UI with actionable cards (e.g., "Approve Invoice", "View Forecast") surfaced by the agent.
- **Smart Suggestions:** Agents offer next steps, corrections, and shortcuts based on user input and business context.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Users can ask for any insight, report, or action in plain language—no menus or filters required.
- **Agent-Driven Onboarding:** New users are guided by an agent through setup, mapping, and first actions.
- **Contextual Tool Switching:** Seamlessly move between tools (e.g., analytics, mapping, scheduling) via agent prompts and suggestions.
- **Minimalist Navigation:** Hide complex navigation; let the agent guide users to the right tool or view.
- **Adaptive UI Elements:** UI adapts to device, user skill, and business type for maximum accessibility.

## Best Practices for SMB Simplicity

- Test flows with real SMB users; optimize for speed and clarity.
- Avoid jargon, technical terms, and complex forms.
- Use agentic explanations for every action and result.
- Provide undo, help, and fallback options in every flow.
- Continuously refine UI based on user feedback and GenAI UX research.
