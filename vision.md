# 🧭 Dyocense Decision Kernel Platform (DDKP)
## The Open-Standard Decision Intelligence Layer for the Agent Economy

### 🌍 Vision
AI can reason and retrieve, but it struggles to decide. Dyocense provides the missing Decision Kernel — 
a framework that turns natural-language goals into optimal, explainable, and verifiable decisions, using 
the combined power of LLMs, Forecasting, and Operational Research (OR).

### 💡 Problem
LLMs produce insights but not executable plans; OR frameworks require mathematical expertise; SMEs lack data-science capacity. 
Dyocense bridges that gap — giving every AI agent or SaaS app the ability to plan and act optimally.

### 🧩 Product Flow
Goal → Forecast → Optimise → Explain → Learn

### ⚙️ Architecture
Control-plane: Gravitee AM, OPA, Billing, Quotas, Marketplace
Data-plane: Compiler, Forecast, Optimise, Explain, Evidence Graph
Storage: MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, Neo4j
Orchestration: Temporal + KEDA + Kubernetes
Observability: OpenTelemetry + CloudEvents

### 🧱 Technical Pillars
- Contract-First (JSON-Schema, OpenAPI)
- Composable Agents (LangGraph)
- Deterministic OR (OR-Tools, Pyomo, HiGHS)
- Forecast Plug-ins (Darts, Prophet, SKTime)
- Trust & Compliance (a1facts, OPA)
- Cloud-Native Scalability (Temporal, KEDA)

### 🧩 Open-Standard DNA
OpenAPI 3.1, JSON-Schema 2020-12, CloudEvents, OpenTelemetry, OCI, ONNX/PMML, OPA/Kyverno

### 🚀 Product Lines
1. Decision Kernel (API SaaS)
2. SDKs & Connectors (LangChain, Copilot, Sheets)
3. Marketplace (OCI bundles)
4. Evidence Graph Dashboard
5. SME Copilots (Inventory, Staffing, Energy)

### 📈 Roadmap
| Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| MVP Q1–Q2 2025 | Core OPS/Pack API | Inventory + Staffing archetypes |
| v1.0 Q3 2025 | Multi-tenant Cloud | Billing, SDKs, Marketplace |
| v1.5 Q4 2025 | Evidence Graph | Neo4j + Explain service |
| v2.0 2026 | Agent Ecosystem | ChatGPT/Copilot tools |
| v3.0 2027 | Federation + Standardisation | LF AI submission |

### 💸 Business Model
API SaaS (usage-based), Enterprise License, Marketplace revenue share, Integration services, Analytics add-ons.

### ⚖️ Differentiation
- Fully automated Language→Decision pipeline
- Built-in Explainability + Audit Graph
- Policy-verified Compliance
- Open Standards from day one
- Agent-native Integrations

### 🧭 Long-Term Vision
Dyocense will be the “Linux of Decision Intelligence” — the standard kernel for all agentic decision-making.
Every Copilot or automation system that plans, schedules, or optimises will rely on a Dyocense kernel.

### ✨ Manifesto
> Decisions should be explainable, optimal, and open.
Dyocense empowers every business and agent to decide intelligently, transparently, and autonomously.
