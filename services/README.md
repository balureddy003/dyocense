# Services

This directory hosts deployable microservices that power the Dyocense Decision Kernel Platform (compiler, knowledge, scenario, forecast, policy, optimiser, diagnostician, explainer, evidence, marketplace, orchestrator, etc.). Each service exposes its own README detailing setup, local development, and deployment conventions. Phase 5 adds marketplace capabilities, a background orchestration API, and SDK-aligned endpoints while retaining bearer-token enforcement across the stack.
